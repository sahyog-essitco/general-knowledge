**UART, I2C, and SPI** are communication protocols used in embedded systems to allow microcontrollers, sensors, and other peripherals to communicate with each other. Each protocol has its strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.

### **1. Definition**

- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter):**
  - A simple, asynchronous, point-to-point communication protocol used for serial communication between devices.
  - Communication happens without a clock signal, using start and stop bits for synchronization.
  - It is often used in serial communication like RS-232.

- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit):**
  - A multi-master, multi-slave, synchronous, serial communication protocol that uses two wires: SDA (data line) and SCL (clock line).
  - Devices communicate via a shared bus, and the protocol supports multiple devices on the same bus.
  - Widely used for communication between sensors, memory chips, and other low-speed devices.

- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface):**
  - A synchronous, full-duplex communication protocol typically used for high-speed communication between a master device and one or more slaves.
  - Uses four lines: MISO (Master In Slave Out), MOSI (Master Out Slave In), SCK (Serial Clock), and SS (Slave Select).
  - It is faster than I2C and is used in applications requiring high data throughput.
